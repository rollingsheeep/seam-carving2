# MPI Implementation Performance Analysis

## Current Performance Issues

### 1. Communication Overhead
- Excessive use of MPI_Bcast operations for data synchronization
- Frequent broadcasting of entire image data during seam removal
- Multiple MPI_Allreduce operations in hybrid energy calculation
- Communication overhead outweighs parallel computation benefits for small process counts

### 2. Inefficient Data Distribution
- Full image broadcast to all processes, even when only partial data is needed
- Unnecessary memory usage and communication overhead
- Potential cache misses due to memory overhead

### 3. Synchronization Bottlenecks
- Multiple MPI_Barrier calls forcing all processes to wait
- Row-by-row synchronization in dynamic programming phase
- Synchronization points creating bottlenecks with few processes

### 4. Memory Management Issues
- Each process maintains full copies of matrices (img, lum, grad, dp)
- Frequent resizing and copying during seam removal
- Inefficient memory operations

### 5. Load Imbalance
- Row-based division may not be optimal for all image sizes
- Uneven work distribution, especially with small process counts
- Last process handling remainder rows creates imbalance

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Communication Reduction
- Replace broadcasts with targeted sends
- Use MPI_Scatterv for initial data distribution
- Implement non-blocking communication
- Minimize global reductions in hybrid energy calculation

### 2. Memory Optimization
- Store only necessary rows per process
- Use more efficient data structures
- Implement memory pools
- Reduce allocation overhead

### 3. Load Balancing
- Implement 2D decomposition
- Use dynamic work distribution
- Consider task-based parallelism
- Optimize work distribution for small process counts

### 4. Synchronization Optimization
- Minimize barrier usage
- Use asynchronous communication
- Implement more parallel-friendly algorithms
- Consider lock-free approaches where possible

### 5. Hybrid Energy Calculation Optimization
- Use local statistics first
- Reduce global reductions
- Cache intermediate results
- Implement more efficient normalization
